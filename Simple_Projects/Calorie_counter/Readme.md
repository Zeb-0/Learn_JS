# Calorie counter
In this project i will be advancing my skills in html/css and javascript by building a simple calorie counter.  
It will entail all basic daily activities/routine of an average normal person.  
## Functionality:
The app should:
- Accept input from user for each activity done - calori plans (budget and consumption)
- Calculate based on input - calories consumed  & burned
- Relay to the user the final outcome of their daily activity - result of the calculations(calories)
